        <p><span style="background-color: aquamarine;">Imagine a trial scene at the end of a Mob movie, 
            with a wood-panelled courtroom and a white-haired judge.  lorem
            The old don at the defense table, surrounded by slick lawyers.
             The striving prosecutors. <span style="background-color:bisque">The armed security.</span>
              The sworn witnesses, one by one, pressed to stay loyal or turn rat.
              That has pretty much been the scene on the fifteenth floor
               of the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse these past few weeks,
               during former President Donald Trumpâ€™s hush-money triall</span></p>
