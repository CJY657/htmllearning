<hr>
    <pre>
    You're a vodka drink
    With two lemons and no lime
    You won't listen to the words
    But you'll sing 'em when they rhyme
    You're a Sunday backwards ball cap
    Drive too fast when it rains
    And you talk like you're from Charleston
    But you're just made that way
    </pre>

    <pre>
    Everything falls into place
    As soon as I see your face
    Don't stop loving me
    Baby don't stop loving me       
    </pre>
